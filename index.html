I am an post-doctoral at the SKA Observatory in the UK. My research primarirly focusses on understanding how Lyman Continuum and Lyman-alpha photons leaks from galaxies. 

Before joining SKAO I was a postdoc at the Observatoire de Geneve, Switzerland working with Prof. Daniel Schaerer in the Starbursts in the Universe group. I completed my Ph.D in "Star-formation in and around nearby galaxies" from the National Centre for Radio Astrophyscis, Pune, India under the supervision of Prof. Yogesh Wadadekar in 2020.
