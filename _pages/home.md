I am a post-doctoral at the [SKA Observatory](https://www.skao.int/en) in the UK. My research work broadly focusses to understand extreme galaxies which challenge our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. To this end I use a combination of large scale observations (in UV/optical to radio) and physical modelling. 

Before joining SKAO I was a postdoc at the Observatoire de Geneve, Switzerland working with Prof. Daniel Schaerer in the Starbursts in the Universe group. I completed my Ph.D in "Star-formation in and around nearby galaxies" from the National Centre for Radio Astrophyscis - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Pune, India in 2020 under [Prof. Yogesh Wadadekar](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~yogesh/).
