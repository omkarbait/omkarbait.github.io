I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [SKA Observatory](https://www.skao.int/en) in the UK. My research focusses on understanding the formation of extreme galaxies which challenge our current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. To this end I use a combination of observations using state-of-the-art facilities in the UV/optical to radio and physical modelling. I also work on incorporating AI/ML in galaxy formation studies and to develop novel radio data reduction techniques.   

Before joining SKAO I was a postdoc at the [Observatoire de Geneve](https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/en/), Switzerland working with [Prof. Daniel Schaerer](https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/starbursts/team/daniel-schaerer) in the [Starbursts in the Universe](https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/starbursts/) group. My postdoc was funded by [AstroSignals](https://astrosignals.ch/), a SNSF Sinergia Project where I worked together with [Prof. Slava Voloshynovskiy](http://sip.unige.ch/team/prof-sviatoslav-voloshynovskiy/) as part of the Stochastic Information Processing group. I completed my Ph.D in "Star-formation in and around nearby galaxies" from the [National Centre for Radio Astrophyscis - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main), Pune, India in 2020 under [Prof. Yogesh Wadadekar](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~yogesh/).

I am part of several international teams and collaborations which includes the [SKA Science team](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/120/skao-science-contacts), [SKACH](https://skach.org/) collaboration, the [CosmicAI](https://www.cosmicai.org) institute and the LzLCS collaboration.
